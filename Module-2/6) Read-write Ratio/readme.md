- how often the data is being read and how often the data is being written.
- Its the Ratio between Read and Write Operation

## Patterns of read-write Ratio:
### 1) Read Heavy Systems(9:1):
- Social media apps
- Real time analytics
- the system is Optimized for fast Data retrieval and extensive Caching Statergies.

### 2)Write HEavy(1:9):
- Optimized for High throughput ingestion with eventual consistency pattern.

### 3) Balanced(5:5):
- Equal Distribution of reads and writes.
- requires careful optimization of both operations and Hybrid Storage statergies
