# Reducing Latency:
## 1) Use of Content Delivery Networks:
-  A CDN caches static content and serves it to users.
- CDN Edge servers are distributed in multiple locations so that content is stored closer to end users and does not need to travel as far to reach them, Improving Website Performance.
 ## 2) Optinmizing Images for faster loading and reduce File size Wherver Possible!
 -  Code minification is one way of reducing the size of JavaScript and CSS files.
 - It is possible to improve perceived page performance by strategically loading certain assets first

 ## 3) Using Lazy Loading:
 -  Webpages can also load assets only as they are needed
 - These approaches do not actually improve network latency, but they do improve the user's perception of page speed.
